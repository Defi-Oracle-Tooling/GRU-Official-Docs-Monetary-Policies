# Executive Summary

The GRU (Global Reserve Unit) monetary policy framework establishes a disciplined, transparent, and adaptive reserve-backed currency system designed to maintain parity stability, liquidity assurance, and multi-jurisdictional governance oversight.

## Core Pillars
1. Parity & Stability: Controlled issuance via atomic triangulation (reserve -> GRU -> distributed units) with predictable expansion ratios and a hard inflation discipline ceiling.
2. Liquidity Management: Bond-driven (Li99) recycling, 40/40/20 allocation logic (reserves / liquidity instruments / strategic programs) ensuring structural balance.
3. Governance & Oversight: Multi-chamber separation (Policy, Risk, Compliance, Technical) plus external audits and open verification.
4. Programmable Expansion: Issuance formulas (E = I × (10/7) × (1 - f)^n) and structured macro/micro cycles enabling scenario modeling.
5. Interoperable Charter: DBIS (Digital Bank for International Settlements) integration path facilitating cross-border settlement standardization.

## Strategic Objectives
- Preserve collateral coverage ≥ defined threshold at all times (dynamic stress-tested coverage ratios).
- Minimize volatility spillover using adaptive control instruments (dynamic fee modulation, temporary throttle windows).
- Standardize reporting (checksum logs, version tagging, multi-format artifact distribution) to support external trust.

## Key Ratios & Signals (Snapshot)
- Core Issuance Ratio: 7:10 reserve-to-circulating expansion baseline.
- Liquidity Allocation: 40% collateral / 40% market operations / 20% strategic buffers.
- Stress Coverage Target: ≥ 120% (illustrative value; tuned per governance cycle).

## Transparency & Integrity
All distributed artifacts are generated via automated build (`scripts/build.sh`) producing Markdown, PDF, DOCX, checksums (SHA256), and a consolidated ZIP bundle. Integrity is verifiable publicly through reproducible hashing and optional GPG signing.

## Forward Look
Immediate enhancements include:
- Diagrammatic clarity (issuance cycle, triangulation flow, governance structure).
- CI-based reproducible builds (GitHub Actions) with artifact publishing.
- Optional cryptographic signing of verification logs.

## Usage Guidance
Readers should start here, then proceed to section 01 for policy mechanics and section 02 for issuance flow modeling. Governance and charter sections (04 & 05) contextualize institutional alignment. Roadmap (06) outlines expansion vectors.
