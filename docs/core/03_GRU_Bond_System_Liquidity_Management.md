# GRU Bond System & Liquidity Management

## 1. Overview
Closed-loop perpetual hybrid bonds (Li99-series) provide elastic liquidity while preserving reserve-backed solvency.

## 2. Instruments
| Code | Name | Purpose | Term | Buy-back |
|------|------|---------|------|----------|
| Li99PpOsB10 | 99y Perpetual Off-set Bond | Collateral counterweight & stabilization | 99y | 10-year cycle |
| Li99PpAvB10 | 99y Perpetual Avail Bond | Expansion & availability conduit | 99y | 10-year cycle |

## 3. Acquisition Example (€100M Base)
Discount purchase price assumption: 15% (85% discount)
```
Notional = 100M / 0.15 = 666.667M
Per Bond Allocation = 666.667M / 2 ≈ 333.333M
Coverage per bond ≈ 250M
```

## 4. Triangle Servicing Loop
Bond servicing integrated with atomic issuance & 40/40/20 cycles:
- Deposit enters Banker’s Assistance
- Three atomic loops executed (n=3)
- Net liquidity assigned to coverage + stabilization
- Coupons funnel into reserve reinforcement and future buy-back escrow

## 5. Coupon Flow
| Stage | Action | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Accrual | Coupons accumulate | Increases reinvestment capacity |
| Allocation | Portion to buy-back escrow | Guarantees 10-year cycle completion |
| Rollover | Excess reinvested | Expands reserve cushion / reduces volatility |

## 6. Stability Logic
| Mechanism | Function | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Discounted Purchase | Low upfront outlay | High coverage leverage |
| Coupon Reinvestment | Compounding | Self-funding sustainability |
| Buy-back Protocol | Principal retirement | Maintains trust & solvency |
| Dual-Bond Structure | Functional separation | Predictable liquidity response |

## 7. Key Ratios
- Coverage multiplier: ≈ 2.5× base reserve per cycle
- Coupon efficiency target: ≥ 65% reinvestment retention
- Buy-back funding threshold: 100% of discounted principal by year 10

## 8. Governance & Oversight
- Managed by Bond Servicing Chamber (BSC)
- Audited quarterly by Reserve Audit Chamber (RAC)
- Real-time monitoring through DSL bond registry

## 9. Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Coupon underperformance | Market or yield compression | Adaptive yield adjustment matrix |
| Discount volatility | Market pricing drift | Pre-commit binding issuance pricing windows |
| Escrow depletion | Unexpected market stress | Dynamic surplus top-up via stabilization tranche |
| Maturity mismatch | Cycle slippage | Smart contract enforced checkpoints |

## 10. Future Enhancements
- Multi-curve bonding (tranching coupons by velocity tiers)
- ESG-linked coupon channel (green reserve expansion pool)
- Synthetic bond wrappers for secondary institutional access

## Summary
Li99-series bonds enable scalable, self-redeeming liquidity expansion without external leverage, ensuring perpetual stability through structured coupon cycles and reserve-tied buy-back mechanics.
