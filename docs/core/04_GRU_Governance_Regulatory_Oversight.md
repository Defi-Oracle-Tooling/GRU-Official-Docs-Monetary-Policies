# GRU Governance & Regulatory Oversight Framework

## 1. Entity Model
The GRU operates under a Sovereign Hybrid Trust Entity (SHTE) combining trust law neutrality with multi-chamber institutional oversight.

## 2. Chambers
| Chamber | Scope | Core Outputs |
|---------|------|--------------|
| MPC (Monetary Policy) | Parity, issuance, expansion limits | Policy directives, parity adjustments |
| RAC (Reserve Audit) | Proof-of-Reserves & custody verification | Quarterly audit attestations |
| BSC (Bond Servicing) | Li99 cycles, coupon allocation | Bond cycle performance reports |
| TLC (Technology & Ledger) | DSL integrity, smart contract ops | Ledger upgrade proposals, security reviews |
| ECC (Ethics & Compliance) | AML/KYC, legal neutrality, conduct | Compliance certifications |

## 3. Oversight Principles
- Transparency: Real-time reserve + bond cycle stats
- Accountability: Segregated chamber authority w/ multi-sig approvals
- Integrity: Cryptographic anchoring of issuance & redemption events
- Resilience: Geographic and operational redundancy (multi-region custody)

## 4. Legal Recognition
- UNCITRAL framework alignment
- Arbitration seat: New York (primary); auxiliary hubs: Geneva, Singapore, Dubai
- Treated as PIMI (Private International Monetary Instrument)

## 5. Compliance Standards
| Area | Metric | Enforcement |
|------|-------|------------|
| Expansion | ≤ 2.75% annual net | MPC + ACP automated burns |
| Coverage | ≥ 120% reserves | RAC audits w/ DSL attestation |
| Parity Drift | ±2.5% threshold | MPAP activation |
| Bond Buy-back | ≤ 10-year cycle | BSC escrow validation |

## 6. Ethical Protocols
- Conflict-of-interest segregation (no cross-chamber executive overlap >40%)
- Whistleblower protected reporting channel (hashed submission proofs)
- Open-source publication of key smart contracts (transparency baseline)

## 7. Integration with Digital BIS (DBIS)
- MPC ↔ DBIS Monetary Council coordination
- RAC feeds DBIS Reserve Registry
- TLC enforces interoperability via ISO 20022 mapping & cross-ledger event adapters

## 8. Committee Charters and Detailed Structure

### 8.1 Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
#### Charter and Responsibilities
- **Mandate**: Gold parity maintenance, expansion parameters, issuance authorization
- **Composition**: 5 members (3 internal, 2 external experts)
- **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum 3 members for decisions
- **Decision Authority**: Parity adjustments within ±2.5%, expansion limits
- **Meeting Frequency**: Monthly (emergency sessions as required)
- **Independence Requirements**: No direct financial interest in GRU operations

#### Key Policy Tools
```yaml
MPC_Policy_Instruments:
  Parity_Adjustment_Protocol: "±2.5% tolerance band management"
  Expansion_Controls: "Annual 2.75% maximum net issuance"
  Reserve_Adequacy: "120% minimum backing requirement"
  Liquidity_Management: "Li99 bond cycle coordination"
```

### 8.2 Reserve Audit Committee (RAC)
#### Charter and Responsibilities
- **Mandate**: Independent reserve verification, custody oversight, PoR validation
- **Composition**: 4 members (1 internal, 3 external auditors)
- **Independence**: Fully independent from operational management
- **Reporting**: Direct board reporting, regulatory transparency
- **Audit Standards**: ISAE 3000 (Revised) compliance

#### Audit Framework
- **Quarterly PoR Attestation**: Independent verification of reserve holdings
- **Annual Comprehensive Audit**: Full custody and valuation review
- **Surprise Inspections**: Unscheduled vault and account verification
- **Third-Party Validation**: External auditor coordination

### 8.3 Enhanced Compliance Committee (ECC)
#### Charter and Expanded Responsibilities
- **AML/CFT Oversight**: Enterprise-wide risk assessment and monitoring
- **Regulatory Compliance**: MiCA, DORA, SEPA compliance coordination
- **Ethics and Conduct**: Conflict management, whistleblower protection
- **Cross-Border Compliance**: Multi-jurisdictional regulatory alignment

#### Compliance Framework Integration
```yaml
Compliance_Integration:
  MiCA_Compliance:
    - "ART/EMT authorization maintenance"
    - "Reserve management oversight"
    - "White paper accuracy validation"
    
  DORA_Implementation:
    - "ICT risk management oversight"
    - "Incident response coordination"

```

## 9. Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) Methodology Enhancement

### 9.1 Real-Time Transparency Framework

- **API Access**: Public API for third-party verification

### 9.2 Independent Audit Cadence
```yaml
Audit_Schedule:
  Quarterly_Attestation:
    Auditor: "Big 4 accounting firm (rotating)"
    Standards: "ISAE 3000 (Revised)"
    Scope: "Reserve existence and valuation"
    Publication: "Within 30 days of quarter-end"
    
  Annual_Comprehensive_Review:
    Scope: "Full PoR methodology and controls"
    External_Validation: "Independent custody verification"
    Regulatory_Submission: "Full compliance attestation"
```

## 10. Audit & Reporting Cadence
