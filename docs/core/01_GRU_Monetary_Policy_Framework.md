# GRU Monetary Policy Framework

## Overview
The Global Reserve Unit (GRU) establishes a multi-tier, asset-backed monetary system, anchoring all liquidity via XAU (gold) to ensure intrinsic value, auditable parity, and cross-domain convertibility.

## Core Ratios
```
1 M00 GRU = 5 M0 GRU
1 M00 GRU = 25 M1 GRU
1 M00 GRU = x M0 GRU + y M1 GRU
```
Dynamic coefficients (x, y) are policy-adjusted distribution weights between M0 (institutional) and M1 (commercial) layers.

## Face & Asset Values
```
1 XAU GRU = 1.2 XAU
1 M0 GRU = 1.2 XAU GRU
1.0 LiXAU = 1.2 / 0.9475^4 XAU
```
LiXAU is a composite hybrid reserve index used for diversification and ESG alignment.

## Layer Structure
| Layer | Function | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| M00 | Sovereign Issuance | Base creation tied 1:1 to audited reserves |
| M0  | Institutional Reserve | Interbank & authority level liquidity instrument |
| M1  | Commercial Circulation | Market & settlement eMoney layer |

## Reserve Policy
- Minimum coverage: ≥ 120% of circulating GRU value.
- Asset tiers: Primary (XAU), secondary (Li, Pt, REE, sovereign ETFs), dynamic (tokenized verified assets).
- Parity deviation threshold: ±2.5% triggers MPAP (Monetary Parity Adjustment Protocol).

## Governance
Operates under Sovereign Hybrid Trust Entity (SHTE) with chambers:
- Monetary Policy Chamber (MPC)
- Reserve Audit Chamber (RAC)
- Bond Servicing Chamber (BSC)
- Technology & Ledger Chamber (TLC)
- Ethics & Compliance Chamber (ECC)

## Control Instruments
| Instrument | Purpose | Trigger |
|------------|---------|---------|
| MPAP | Adjust parity to XAU | Parity drift > 2.5% |
| ACP | Liquidity compression / burn | Excess supply > target band |
| Bond Yield Modulation | Supply elasticity | Velocity / inflation signals |

## Transparency
- Quarterly Proof-of-Reserves (PoR)
- Public Reserve Dashboard (planned)
- Smart ledger transaction attestations

## Inflation Ceiling
Annual net expansion capped at 2.75% unless crisis override executed by unanimous MPC + RAC vote.

## Summary
The framework combines mathematically disciplined issuance, gold parity, and multi-layer liquidity routing to form a sovereign-neutral, auditable reserve standard.
