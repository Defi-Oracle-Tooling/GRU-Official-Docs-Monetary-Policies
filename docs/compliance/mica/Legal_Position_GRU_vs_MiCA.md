# Legal Position: GRU Classification Under MiCA

## Executive Summary

This legal memorandum analyzes the classification of the Global Reserve Unit (GRU) and its monetary tiers (M00, M0, M1) under **Regulation (EU) 2023/1114** on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), effective from June 2024.

## 1. MiCA Framework Overview

### 1.1 Relevant Token Categories (Art. 3 MiCA)

| Token Type | Definition | Key Characteristics |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Asset-Referenced Token (ART)** | Crypto-asset that maintains stable value by reference to another value or right | Backed by reserve assets, price stability mechanism |
| **E-money Token (EMT)** | Crypto-asset that maintains stable value by reference to fiat currency | 1:1 backing by fiat currency, redeemable at par |
| **Utility Token** | Crypto-asset intended to provide digital access to goods/services | No investment purpose, functional utility only |

### 1.2 Regulatory Thresholds (Art. 43-44 MiCA)

- **Significant ART**: Average reserve value >€5B over 6 months OR >10M transactions per day
- **Significant EMT**: Average outstanding amount >€1B over 6 months OR >2M transactions per day

## 2. GRU Classification Analysis

### 2.1 M00 - Sovereign Issuance Layer

**Classification: OUT OF SCOPE (Sovereign Exemption)**

| MiCA Provision | Analysis | Conclusion |
|----------------|----------|------------|
| **Art. 2(2)(a)** | Central bank digital currencies exempted | M00 qualifies as sovereign digital reserve |
| **Art. 2(2)(e)** | Instruments used solely by institutional investors | M00 limited to sovereign/central bank entities |
| **Recital 10** | No impact on monetary sovereignty | M00 enhances rather than replaces sovereign monetary policy |

**Legal Basis:** M00 operates as a **digital sovereign reserve instrument** under international monetary law, similar to SDRs (Special Drawing Rights), outside MiCA's retail crypto-asset scope.

### 2.2 M0 - Institutional Reserve Layer

**Classification: ASSET-REFERENCED TOKEN (ART) - Potentially Significant**

| MiCA Requirement | M0 Compliance Approach | Implementation Status |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Reserve Backing (Art. 36)** | Gold-collateralized with 120% coverage ratio | ✅ Implemented |
| **Reserve Custody (Art. 37)** | Multi-jurisdictional custody with independent custodians | ✅ Implemented |
| **Redemption Rights (Art. 39)** | Continuous redemption at fair value via authorized dealers | ✅ Implemented |
| **Risk Management (Art. 35)** | Comprehensive risk framework with stress testing | ✅ Implemented |

### 2.3 M1 - Commercial eMoney Layer

**Classification: E-MONEY TOKEN (EMT)**

| MiCA Requirement | M1 Compliance Approach | Implementation Status |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Fiat Backing (Art. 48)** | 1:1 EUR backing via segregated bank accounts | ✅ Ready for implementation |
| **Redemption at Par (Art. 49)** | Immediate redemption at face value | ✅ Ready for implementation |
| **Reserve Requirements (Art. 50)** | Full segregation in credit institutions | ✅ Partner agreements in place |
| **Investment Restrictions (Art. 50)** | Limited to secure, liquid assets | ✅ Policy framework established |
