# GRU Risk Annex

## 1. Purpose
Catalog primary systemic, operational, financial, technological, legal, and governance risks inherent in the GRU architecture and outline mitigation strategies.

## 2. Risk Categories
| Category | Risk | Description | Mitigation |
|----------|------|-------------|-----------|
| Reserve Integrity | Asset Volatility | XAU or hybrid asset price shock | Dynamic reweighting (LiXAU adjunct), volatility collars |
| Parity Stability | Drift Beyond ±2.5% | Sustained deviation from gold anchor | MPAP automated adjustment + stabilization tranche deployment |
| Bond Performance | Coupon Shortfall | Underperforming yields delaying buy-back | Adaptive coupon matrix + contingency reserve top-up |
| Liquidity Elasticity | Over-Expansion | Excess M1 issuance beyond demand | ACP enforced burns + velocity gating |
| Oracle Integrity | Data Manipulation | Malicious or faulty price feeds | Multi-oracle quorum + cryptographic attestation |
| Governance Capture | Centralization | Chamber dominance or collusion | Segregated authority, rotation schedule, transparency audits |
| Compliance/Regulatory | Jurisdictional Challenge | Legal uncertainty or classification conflict | PIMI registration + multi-jurisdiction counsel network |
| Technology & Security | Smart Contract Exploit | Vulnerability leading to unauthorized issuance | Formal verification + layered audit + emergency pause function |
| Settlement Interoperability | Bridge Failure | Cross-ledger/CBDC adapter malfunction | Redundant adapter cluster + failover routing |
| Adoption & Market | Low Institutional Uptake | Insufficient early participation | Phased onboarding incentives + PoR transparency + education (GRU Academy) |
| ESG Alignment | Sustainability Gap | Reserves not meeting green mandates | ESG reserve floor (10%) + external certification integration |
| Operational Continuity | Custody Disruption | Vault or infrastructure outage | Geo-redundant custody + disaster recovery runbooks |

## 3. Quantitative Monitoring Metrics
| Metric | Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Coverage Ratio | ≥ 120% | < 118% |
| Parity Drift Events (annual) | ≤ 4 | > 4 |
| Buy-back Cycle Completion | 100% by Year 10 | < 90% trajectory at Year 8 |
| Velocity Volatility (VGRU) | ±10% band | > ±15% |
| Oracle Discrepancy Spread | < 0.25% | ≥ 0.5% |
| Expansion Rate | ≤ 2.75% | > 3.0% |

## 4. Escalation Protocols
| Trigger | Response Step 1 | Step 2 | Step 3 |
|---------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| Parity Breach | Invoke MPAP | Publish bulletin | Adjust reserve weighting |
| Coverage Undershoot | Halt expansion | Deploy stabilization tranche | Increase bond escrow allocation |
| Oracle Failure | Switch to fallback set | Quarantine feed | Forensic audit & patch |
| Governance Conflict | Convene oversight committee | External mediator audit | Charter amendment proposal |
| Smart Contract Exploit | Pause affected module | Rollback state (if scoped) | Patch & re-verify |

## 5. Mitigation Tools Inventory
| Tool | Function | Owner |
|------|---------|-------|
| MPAP | Parity correction | MPC |
| ACP | Supply compression | MPC/TLC |
| Coupon Escrow | Bond cycle guarantee | BSC |
| Multi-Oracle Quorum | Price data validation | TLC |
| Reserve Dashboard | Transparency & trust | RAC/TLC |
| Governance Rotation Scheduler | Decentralization enforcement | ECC/MPC |
| Formal Verification Pipeline | Smart contract assurance | TLC |
| ESG Reserve Floor | Sustainability compliance | ECC/RAC |

## 6. Residual Risks & Notes
- Extreme gold price dislocations may exceed algorithmic parity adjustment elasticity.
- Multi-asset triangulation introduces basis risk across secondary anchors.
- Legal classification evolution (e.g., new digital asset statutes) may require charter amendments.

## 7. Forward Improvements
- AI-assisted anomaly detection for velocity & oracle manipulation patterns.
- Distributed attestation network (stake-weighted integrity proofs).
- Enhanced stress-test simulation engine (Monte Carlo parity shock modeling).

## 8. Disclaimer
This annex is provisional; quantitative thresholds and mitigation tools are subject to refinement after initial operational telemetry collection.
