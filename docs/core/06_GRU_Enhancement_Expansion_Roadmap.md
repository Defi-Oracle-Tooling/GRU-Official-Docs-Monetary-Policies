# GRU Enhancement & Expansion Roadmap

## 1. Strategic Objectives
Transition GRU from architectural foundation to globally recognized, multi-asset settlement layer integrated with DBIS.

## 2. Policy Enhancements
| Objective | Target | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Inflation Mandate | ≤ 2.5% | Hard-coded annual expansion ceiling (non-crisis) |
| Reserve Growth | 1.2× YoY cap | Aligns expansion with real asset accumulation |
| Parity Corridor | ±1.5% | ERM-G dynamic adjustment band vs XAU/SDR |

## 3. Monetary Aggregate Extension
| Layer | Function | Rationale |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| M2 GRU | Savings + locked instruments | Institutional stability & time deposits |
| M3 GRU | Derivatives & structured products | Market maturity & liquidity depth |

## 4. Technical Enhancements
- Adaptive atomic cycle orchestration based on velocity thresholds
- Multi-anchor reserve matrix (XAU/XAG/XPT + LiXAU composite)
- Ledger resiliency: multi-region replication + threshold signatures

## 5. Governance Evolution
Add GRU Monetary Authority (GMA) as permanent secretariat coordinating:
- Policy simulation sandbox
- Cross-chamber risk scoring
- ESG-linked reserve integration metrics

## 6. Transparency & Reporting
| Artifact | Frequency | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| PoR/F (Proof-of-Reserves & Flow) | Quarterly | End-to-end asset & circulation verification |
| Digital Monetary Stability Report (DMSR) | Annual | Macro health & volatility analysis |
| Velocity Index Publication | Monthly | Policy tuning signal |

## 7. Implementation Phases
| Phase | Timeline | Key Actions |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Phase 1: Formation | 0–12m | SHTE registration, ledger deployment, initial PoR |
| Phase 2: Integration | 12–24m | CBDC bridges, bond cycle live, VGRU metrics start |
| Phase 3: Recognition | 24–48m | DRB index listing, SDR parity pursuit, expanded membership |

## 8. Interoperability Targets
- ISO 20022 settlement event mapping
- CBDC API connectors (pilot nodes)
- Tokenized commodity feed oracles (redundant, signed)

## 9. ESG & Sustainability Layer
| Initiative | Mechanism | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Green Reserve Allocation | 10% reserve floor | Aligns with global sustainability standards |
| Carbon Credit Pool (GRU-Carbon) | Token wrapper | Net-neutral issuance operations |
| ESG Audit Integration | Third-party certification | Reputation & compliance uplift |

## 10. Risk Mitigation Enhancements
| Risk | Enhancement |
|------|------------|
| Oracle Compromise | Multi-oracle quorum + failover sequencing |
| Bond Underperformance | Dynamic coupon adjustment matrix |
| Parity Shock | Emergency corridor widening protocol |
| Governance Drift | Scheduled chamber rotation & transparent metrics |

## 11. Future Innovation Channels
- Reserve AI analytics (predictive parity stress modeling)
- Programmable settlement conditions (conditional atomic issuance)
- Inter-ledger universal adapter (DBIS ↔ external institutional ledgers)

## 12. Success Metrics
| Metric | Target | Horizon |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Reserve Coverage Stability | ≥ 120% maintained | Continuous |
| Parity Drift Events | < 4/year | Annual |
| Velocity Index Volatility | ±10% band | Year 2 |
| CBDC Integration Count | ≥ 5 | Year 3 |
| DRB Composite Adoption | Indexed on ≥2 exchanges | Year 4 |

### Velocity Metrics Diagram
The composite velocity index (V_GRU) integrates adjusted transaction cadence, coverage weighting, and stability filtering:

![Velocity Metrics (V_GRU)](../media/velocity_metrics.pdf)

Where:
- v_raw = Tx_count / Interval
- v_adj = Tx_value / Float
- v_cov = v_adj × (Coverage / 120%)
- Stab ∈ [0,1] after outlier filtering
- V_GRU = w1·v_adj + w2·v_cov + w3·Stab (weights tuned by volatility regime)

## Dashboard & Registry Formula Integration

- **LiCRI (Face-Value Composite):**
  ```
  LiCRI = (LiXAU + LiPMG + LiBMG1 + LiBMG2 + LiBMG3) / 5
  ```
  Used for monthly dashboard and reporting.

- **M00 Composite (Asset-Backed Collateral):**
  ```
  1 M00 = 1.2 × (LiXAU + LiPMG + LiBMG1 + LiBMG2 + LiBMG3)
  ```
  Used for reserve magnitude and issuance collateral.

## Summary
This roadmap operationalizes GRU as a transparent, adaptive, and globally interoperable monetary infrastructure, enabling resilient institutional adoption under the DBIS umbrella.
